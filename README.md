# Digital-Clock-using-STM32F103C8-and-ST7735S-Display
This project is a digital clock system built using an STM32F103C8 microcontroller interfaced with a TFT ST7735S 1.8-inch display. The clock functionality relies on the Real-Time Clock (RTC) peripheral of the STM32F103C8 microcontroller to accurately maintain and display the current time.
