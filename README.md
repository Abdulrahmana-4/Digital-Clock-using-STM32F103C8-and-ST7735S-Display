# Overview
This project is a digital clock system built using an STM32F103C8 microcontroller interfaced with a TFT ST7735S 1.8-inch display. The clock functionality relies on the Real-Time Clock (RTC) peripheral of the STM32F103C8 microcontroller to accurately maintain and display the current time.
## Features:
1. **Real-Time Clock (RTC) Integration:** 
   * Utilizes the RTC peripheral of the STM32F103C8 microcontroller for accurate timekeeping.
   * Enables setting and updating the current time and date.
2. **Display Interface:**
   * Interfaced with the ST7735S 1.8-inch TFT display for visual representation of the time.
   * Displays the current time in digital format with clear visibility.

## Requirements:
* STM32F103C8 microcontroller board.
* ST7735S 1.8-inch TFT display.
* STM32CubeIDE or similar development environment for STM32 microcontrollers.
